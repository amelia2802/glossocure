        <article id="paragraph">After a long day at school and work, I often rent a movie as a way of relaxing in the evening.
          I usually drop by a local video rental store on my way home, and a movie only costs a few dollars.
          I also belong to an online video rental Website, so I can rent movies from the comfort of my home. 
          I sometimes invite friends over to watch the movies together. We sometimes make popcorn or order a pizza to eat with the movie. 
          I like most types of movies including comedies and action films, but I canâ€™t stand horror movies. 
          If I rent movies, I just have to remember to return them on time; otherwise, I have to pay late fees.
